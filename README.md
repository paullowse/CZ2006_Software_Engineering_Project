Hello, we are Team 4 from BCS 1! Our Project is called Hawkerpedia, which is a one-stop hawker centre mobile application for Singaporean users!

Hawker Centres are a significant part of the Singaporean identity and are commonly frequented by Singaporeans.
Thus, our group believes in making the Singaporean identity of hawker stalls accessible for Singaporeans, to enhance our appreciation for Singaporeâ€™s unique culture and heritage through this app. Therefore, our app is ideal for residents of Singapore who want to dine at hawker centres with specific search or filtering requirements and are trying to find the shortest route there. Our app is extremely relevant and useful for Singaporeans in their everyday life.
